# Planck

Planck is open-source software for measuring the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.
It uses the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages as numerical backends, and Matplotlib provides graphical output.
Planck aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of various quantum mechanical problems, 
ncluding those with Hamiltonians and collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in multiple 
physics applications.
Planck is freely available for use and modification and can be used on all Unix-based platforms and Windows.
Being free of any licensing fees, Planck is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research and the classroom.
